        <h2>A Strand Type Game</h2>
    <p>Death Stranding is a videogame created by Hideo Kojima, who was <strong>notorious</strong> for his previous works of the Metal Gear Solid franchise, published by his former publishing employer, Konami.
        
    </p>
    <h3>The Fall of Kojima</h3>
    <p>  
      Konami fired Kojima due to creative difference, and the most known reason being that Kojima was <strong>too ambitious</strong> in developing the latest Metal Gear Solid title, causing him to 
        go over Konami's budget. 
    </p>
      <h3>A New Beginning</h3>  
      <p>
        After the separation, Hideo Kojima set up his own game development studio, called Kojima Productions with Death Stranding being its very first product.
        His new franchise dissociates from his previous works of Metal Gear Solid, however the spirit of Metal Gear Solid lives on in Death Stranding through fans who felt that Kojima
        was wrongly fired. <strong>Unfortunately,</strong> Death Stranding received many 
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/pzqj80/death_stranding_is_the_worst_game_i_have_ever/">mixed reviews</a> from fans who were not used to this new style of 
        gameplay compared to the Metal Gear series and 
        confusing storyline, however that has not stopped Hideo Kojima from being able to develop and announce Death Stranding 2 coming in the near future.
